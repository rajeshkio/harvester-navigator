**Harvester Troubleshooting via UI** is a comprehensive web-based dashboard designed to work with the Harvester support bundle simulator, providing real-time insights into Harvester-based Kubernetes virtual machines and their associated resources. The tool can also be used directly with live Harvester clusters for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool is designed to provide a **holistic view of Harvester clusters** and enable rapid issue identification. It's built primarily to accompany the **Harvester support bundle simulator** for troubleshooting scenarios, while also supporting direct connections to live Harvester clusters.

## ✨ Features

### 🌐 **Web Dashboard**
- **Real-time monitoring** of Harvester clusters via WebSocket connections
- **Interactive VM explorer** with detailed drill-down capabilities
- **Comprehensive node dashboard** showing Longhorn node status and disk information

### 🔍 **VM & Infrastructure Insights**
- **Complete VM lifecycle tracking** - Status, resources, and configuration details
- **Advanced storage analytics** - PVC, volumes, and Longhorn-specific information
- **Replica health monitoring** - Detailed replica status with networking information
- **VMI details** - Guest OS, memory usage, and network interface information
- **Pod relationship mapping** - VM to Pod to Node associations

### 🚨 **Intelligent Error Detection**
- **Automatic issue identification** - Missing volumes, failed replicas, connection problems
- **Structured error reporting** - Categorized by severity (Warning, Error, Critical)
- **Resource-specific diagnostics** - Pinpoint exactly which components are failing
- **Troubleshooting guidance** - Clear error messages with actionable information

### 📊 **Upgrade & Version Tracking**
- **Harvester upgrade history** - Track version progressions and upgrade status
- **Node-level upgrade status** - Monitor upgrade success across cluster nodes
- **Upgrade timeline** - See when upgrades were performed and their outcomes


## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Harvester cluster** OR **Harvester support bundle simulator**
- **kubectl** configured with access to your environment
- **Web browser** for accessing the dashboard

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/rajeshkio/harvester-navigator/releases/latest):

**Choose the binary for your platform:**
- **Linux (x64)**: `harvesterNavigator-linux-amd64`
- **Linux (ARM64)**: `harvesterNavigator-linux-arm64`  
- **macOS (Intel)**: `harvesterNavigator-darwin-amd64`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `harvesterNavigator-darwin-arm64`
- **Windows**: `harvesterNavigator-windows-amd64.exe`

```bash
# Make executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x harvesterNavigator-*

# Run with default port 8080
./harvesterNavigator-linux-amd64

# Run with custom port
./harvesterNavigator-linux-amd64 -port 9090

# Show version information
./harvesterNavigator-linux-amd64 -version

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

For development or if you prefer building from source:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.23+ required
git clone https://github.com/rajeshkio/harvester-navigator.git
cd harvester-navigator
go build -o harvesterNavigator
./harvesterNavigator
```

### macOS Security Notice

If macOS blocks the binary with "unverified developer" error:

**Option 1 - Build from source (Recommended for corporate environments):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajeshkio/harvester-navigator.git
cd harvester-navigator
go build -o harvesterNavigator
./harvesterNavigator
```

**Option 2 - Override security (if allowed by IT policy):**
```bash
# Download the binary, then:
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./harvesterNavigator-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ./harvesterNavigator-darwin-arm64
./harvesterNavigator-darwin-arm64
```

### Windows Usage Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** Double-clicking the .exe file will NOT work because this is a command-line server application.

You must run it from Command Prompt or PowerShell:

**Option 1 - Command Prompt:**
```cmd
# Navigate to download folder
cd Downloads

# Run with default port 8080
harvesterNavigator-windows-amd64.exe

# Run with custom port
harvesterNavigator-windows-amd64.exe -port 9090

# Show version
harvesterNavigator-windows-amd64.exe -version
```

**Option 2 - PowerShell:
```cmd
powershell# Navigate to download folder
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads

# Run the server
.\harvesterNavigator-windows-amd64.exe

# Access dashboard (keep terminal open)
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
```

### Using with Harvester Support Bundle Simulator

```bash
# Start the Harvester simulator
support-bundle-kit simulator --reset

# Download and run harvesterNavigator (it will automatically connect to the simulator)
./harvesterNavigator

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Using with Live Harvester Cluster

```bash
# Set your kubeconfig environment variable
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/harvester-kubeconfig

# Run the application
./harvesterNavigator

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Self-Contained Architecture
The application is distributed as a **single binary** with all static assets (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) embedded directly into the executable using Go's `embed` feature. This means:
- **No external dependencies** - everything needed is in one file
- **Easy deployment** - just copy the binary and run
- **Consistent distribution** - same experience across all platforms

### Web Dashboard Architecture
1. **Backend server** starts and establishes Kubernetes API connections
2. **Automatic environment detection** - Works with both simulator and live clusters
3. **Comprehensive data gathering**:
   - Fetches all Harvester VMs and their metadata
   - Retrieves Longhorn node status and disk information
   - Gathers PVC, volume, and replica details
   - Collects VMI information including guest OS details
   - Tracks Harvester upgrade history and status
4. **Intelligent error detection** identifies missing or failed resources
5. **Interactive UI** presents data with drill-down capabilities for rapid troubleshooting

### Connection Methods
- **Automatic**: Detects simulator kubeconfig at `~/.sim/admin.kubeconfig`
- **Manual**: Uses `KUBECONFIG` environment variable for live cluster connections
- **Fallback**: Uses default kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config`

### Command Line Options
```bash
./harvesterNavigator -h

Usage of ./harvesterNavigator:
  -port string
        Port to run the server on (default "8080")
  -version
        Show version and exit
```
